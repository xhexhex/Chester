# TODO
> A list of things I haven't had the self-discipline to get done yet

* Try compiling and using Chester on Windows
* Investigate how to use Valgrind to check Chester for memory leaks and the like
* Document `che_fen_validator()`
* Rename function `num_of_sqs_in_sq_set()` to `bit_count()`
* Rename `bb_is_sq_bit()` to `is_sq_bit()` and review
* validation_ts: src/validation.c:368: x_validate_fen_test_20: Assertion `p->fmn >= 1 && p->fmn <= 30000` failed.
* `valid_sq_name()` => `is_sq_name()`
* `FEN_HMCF_CONTRADICTS_FMNF_ERROR` is undocumented
* If it's White's turn and EPTS is set, the full move number should be greater than one
